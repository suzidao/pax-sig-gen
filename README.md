# PAX Forum Signature Creator

Way back in the days of yore, when internet forums were the only way to communicate with fellow nerds, forum signatures were a thing. Some say they still are.

This little toy will generate a forum signature comprised of tiny little badges representing all past, present, and future PAX shows. It will download itself onto your computer when you click the "Save" button, and you can upload it wherever you please.

## Features

- Each PAX show has its own collapsible section
  - Collapsing the section will clear all selections for that show
  - Checking the "Select All" box will do what it says
- Selecting a badge type will put a little ribbon on your badge
  - If you are an Enforcer and want to rock the black badge, check the Enforcer box
  - All subsequent badges you select will be of the same type
  - The badge type dropdown will tell you what year you are about to edit
- Badges will wrap according to the number you put in the "# of Rows" box up top
- A badge count keeps track of how many you have selected
